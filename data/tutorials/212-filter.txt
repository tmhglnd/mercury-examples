// === TUTORIAL 212: Filter ===
// The sound of the synth is still very bright. Most synths 
// therefore use a filter to change the color of the sound. 
// This can be done with the `fx(filter)`, the `fx()` is an 
// effect function that allows us to change the sound in 
// various ways

new synth saw time(1/16) fx(filter low 1200 0.6) shape(1 100)
// This filter removes high frequencies above 1200Hz (lowpass)
// And has a little resonance on the cutoff frequency
// Resonance results in a whistling sounding effect
