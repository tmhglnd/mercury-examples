### 5.2: MIDI Duration

With the length() method we can change the duration.The duration of a midi-note is determined by the interval betweenthe note-on and note-off message in milliseconds

```js
new midi default time(1/8) note(0 2) length([50 100 150 200])
```
the list in length() will send different durations
