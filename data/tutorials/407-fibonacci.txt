// === TUTORIAL 407: Fibonacci Numbers ===
// Generate a list of Fibonacci numbers F[n] = F[n-1] + F[n-2]. The fibonacci 
// sequence is famous because it's numbers pop up in nature in many places 
// and when you divide any number in the sequence by its previous number it 
// converges towards the golden ratio (phi, 1.618)
// fibonacci(amount)
// fibonacci(amount, starting number)

// Useful as a starting point for melodic content or modulation of parameters
