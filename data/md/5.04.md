### 5.4: MIDI Chord

By setting the chord() method to 'on' we can outputmultiple notes at the same time to create a chord

```js
new midi default time(1) note([[0 3 7 11]] 2) chord(on)
```
here the chord is created by making a list on the firstplace within another list (otherwise the notes would beplayed in order over time)
