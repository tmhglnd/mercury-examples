// === TUTORIAL 118: Panning ===
// We can make the composition sound more interesting by using the 
// stereo field from our speakers (called panning).
// We can place a sound left with -1, right with 1 and center with 0

new sample violin_c time(1) pan(-1)
new sample pluck_e time(1 3/16) pan(1)
new sample bamboo_g time(1 4/16) pan(0)

// Try some different values for the panning between -1 and 1
