// === TUTORIAL 206: Scales ===
// In many styles of music it is common to not use all the
// notes that are available to us (like all the keys on the piano)
// But instead use a subset of those notes. This is called a scale.
// The scale usually gives a certain feeling to the sound.
// For example major=happy and minor=sad (oversimplification)

// Try changing the scale from major to minor and hear the difference
// You hear some notes twice, because some values between 0-12 
// don't fit in the scale, so they're shifted to the closest value
// that does belong to the scale
