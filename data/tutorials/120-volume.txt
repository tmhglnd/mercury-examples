// === TUTORIAL 20: Volume ===
// Sometimes you want some sounds to sound louder or softer 
// than others. For this we can use the gain() method. 
// A gain of 0 is off, a gain of 1 is the original volume 
// of the soundfile, a gain of 2 is 2x louder (be careful!).

new sample wood_hit gain(0.8) pan(-1)
new sample scrape gain(0.6)
new sample wood_plate gain(0.7) pan(1)

// Try some different values for the gain but be careful with
// values above 1!
