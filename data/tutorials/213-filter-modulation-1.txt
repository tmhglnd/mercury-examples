// === TUTORIAL 213: Filter Modulation ===
// We can modulate the cutoff frequency and the resonance
// of the filter with values from two different lists
// Make sure the cutoffs are values between 50 and 18000 (Hz)
// and the resonance are values between 0 and 1

list cutoffs [200 400 700 1000]
list qs [0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.8]

new synth saw time(1/16) fx(filter low cutoffs qs) shape(1 80)

// Try some different values for both
