### 6.1: Hydra Visuals

We can store hydra sketches as a string in a listBy creating a list of multiple sketches the instrumentwill cycle through them for every trigger

```js
list hydras ['osc(10,0.1,2).out()' 'osc(20,-0.5,5).out()' 'osc(5,1,12).out()']

new sample kick_min time(1/16) play([1 0 0 1 0]) visual(hydras)
```
