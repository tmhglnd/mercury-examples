### 2.2: Filter

The sound of the synth is still very bright. Most synthstherefore use a filter to change the color of the sound.This can be done with the `fx(filter)`, the `fx()` is aneffect function that allows us to change the sound invarious ways

```js
new synth saw time(1/16) fx(filter low 1200 0.6) shape(1 100)
```
This filter removes high frequencies above 1200Hz (lowpass)And has a little resonance on the cutoff frequencyResonance results in a whistling sounding effect
