### 2.5: Octave

With a second argument in the note() function we can choosean octave offset. Stepping up one octave is the same asadding 12 to the semitone.

```js
set tempo 137

list theMelody [0 7 5 3 7 5 2]
list theOctaves [0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2]
new synth saw time(1/16) note(theMelody theOctaves)

```
Here the octave is changed every 3 notes
