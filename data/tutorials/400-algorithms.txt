// === TUTORIAL 400: Algorithmic Composition ===
// This chapter discusses the algorithmic processes that can be used in 
// Mercury. Mercury is heavily inspired by the composition technique Serialism. 
// This technique approaches every musical parameter (rhythm, pitch, dynamics, 
// etc) as an individual sequence of numbers. These sequences can then be 
// transformed in many ways to extend and generate new musical material. 

// With algorithmic processes (functions) we can generate or transform lists. 
// With the lists we can control the parameters in functions of instruments. By 
// combining various list functions we can create more complex outputs.

// This chapter will cover most of the algorithmic methods, but many unique 
// combinations are up to you to discover!

// A list is a collection of items (numbers, words) that has a unique name
list myValues [1 2 3.14 6.18 kick_909 snare_808]

// It is possible to print the content of a list. This is useful to view
// the result of list functions
print myValues
