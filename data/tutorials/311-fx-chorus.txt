// === TUTORIAL 311: FX Chorus / Double ===
// A Chorus and Doubling effect. The Chorus creates 2 copies of the sound.
// One on the left and one right. These copies slowly change in time creating
// modulating effects that make the sound more wider.
// Use the parameters modulation time (division), depth (ms) and wetdry (0-1)

// Giving the effect of hearing 2 instruments.
