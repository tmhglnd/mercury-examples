### 1.7: Start Position

For longer samples it can be useful to start the playbackof the sound at a different position within the sampleYou can do that with the start() function by giving avalue between 0 and 1 (0.5 is halfway through the sound)

```js
list positions [0.7 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.5 0.1]
new sample choir_01 time(1/8) start(positions) shape(1 100 1)

```
The list contains different starting positions in % ofthe length of the sound
