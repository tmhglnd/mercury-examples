// === TUTORIAL 125: Name Instruments ===
// Instruments can have a name. Giving the instrument a name gives two advantages:
// 1. Parameters can be set for the instrument on another line with `set <name>`
// 2. Re-evaluating code will transfer the current count to the new instrument.
//    This will preserve continuity while sequencing (long) lists, instead
//    of hearing the counter reset every time code is evaluated

set tempo 100
set scale minor

list notes spread(13 0 24)
list rhythm euclid(16 13)
new synth saw note(notes 0) time(1/16) play(rhythm) name(synthy)

// these parameters are send to the synth named "synthy"
set synthy fx(filter low 3000 0.3) fx(degrade 0.4) fx(delay)

// try evaluating the code multiple times to hear the pattern does not reset
