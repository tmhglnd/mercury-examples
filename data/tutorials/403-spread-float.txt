// === TUTORIAL 403: Spread Float ===
// Generate a list of n-length containing floating-point numbers
// Starting at x and ending at y (excluding y)
// spreadFloat(size low high) (alias: spreadF)
// spreadInclusiveFloat(size low high) (alias: spreadInclusiveF)

// Useful for parameters that are based on floating-point numbers
// such as sequences for modulation of for example gain and panning

list volume spreadF(16 0 1)
list panning spreadInclusiveF(7 -1 1)
print volume panning
