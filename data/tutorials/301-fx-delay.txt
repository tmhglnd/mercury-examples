new sample piano_g time(2) fx(delay 3/16 2/16 0.8)

// The delay can have arguments for the left/right delaytimes
// in division. A decimal-point value 0-1 determines the amount of fade-out 
// Try different delaytimes: 5/16, 3/4, 1/32, 1/12
// Try changing the values in the function to hear what happens
// It is also possible to modulate the parameters with lists
