// === TUTORIAL 114: Soundscape ===
// We can combine multiple sounds with different 
// speeds to create a kind of soundscape

new sample gong_hi time(4) speed(0.3)
new sample bowl_hi time(3) speed(0.125)
new sample drone_cymbal time(7) speed(0.25)

// Experiment with different time and speed values
// You can use lists for the speed to even more create variations
