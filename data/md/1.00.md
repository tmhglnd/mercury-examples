### 1.0: Volume

Sometimes you want some sounds to sound louder or softerthan others. For this we can use the gain() method.A gain of 0 is off, a gain of 1 is the original volumeof the soundfile, a gain of 2 is 2x louder (be careful!).

```js
new sample wood_hit gain(0.8) pan(-1)
new sample scrape gain(0.6)
new sample wood_plate gain(0.7) pan(1)

```
Try some different values for the gain but be careful withvalues above 1!
