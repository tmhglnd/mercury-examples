// === TUTORIAL 124: Note & Tune ===
// It is also possible to change the pitch of a sample with the 
// note() function, similar to the note function in a synth 
// (see tutorial 203). In the case the sample is not recorded at 
// c4 (midi 60, 261.626Hz) you'll have to set the tune() in order 
// to get the correct pitch transposition. Any adjustments to speed() 
// will also affect the audible pitch together with note().
