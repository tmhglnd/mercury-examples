// === TUTORIAL 307: FX Filter ===
// The filter is a simple filter where the first argument sets the type of the 
// filter such as low(pass), band(pass) and hi(pass). The second argument sets 
// the cutoff frequency with a number or list. The third argument changes the 
// resonance (Q)

new synth saw shape(off) time(1/4) fx(filter low [8000 400 2000 200] [0.2 0.5 0.8])
// Try changing the values in the function to hear what happens
// It is also possible to modulate the parameters with lists

// NOTE: cutoff ramptime in milliseconds is deprecated, now use modulation 
// filter or triggerFilter !!!
