// === TUTORIAL 307: FX Trigger Filter ===
// The trigger filter is a filter where the cutoff frequency is 
// driven by an envelope (shape). The filter is triggered every time
// the note is played. 
// Set the filter type: lowpass, highpass or bandpass.
// Set the attack and release times in milliseconds or relative to the tempo.
// Set the high and low frequency points between which the envelope moves.
