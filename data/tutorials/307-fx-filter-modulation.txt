// === TUTORIAL 307: FX Filter Modulation ===
// We can make even more interesting filter modulations by adding
// a few extra arguments to the filter fx function.
// When doing that we can choose a low and high frequency range
// between which a sinewave, sawtooth up or sawtooth down can modulate
// The modulation time is designed by the division argument

list nts spread(5 0 12)
new synth saw time(1/2) note(nts) shape(off) fx(filter low 1/1 100 4000 0.8)
// this filter modulates up and down once per bar between 100 and 4000 Hz with resonance 0.8

new synth saw time(1/16) note(nts 1) shape(off) fx(filter low 1/16 200 6000 0.6 0 0.05)
// this filter modulates down every 1/16 note from 6000 to 200 Hz with resonance of 0.6
// the 0.2 determins the slope curve the filter goes up/down with (try 0.05 and 1 to hear the difference)

// arguments:
// fx(filter <type> <division> <low> <high> <resonance> <direction> <slope-curve>)
