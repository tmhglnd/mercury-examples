// === TUTORIAL 203: Note ===
// To choose a note to play for the synth we use the note() 
// function. This function expects a number as a semitone (half-step)
// on the piano-keyboard. The numbers can be positive or negative.

new synth saw time(1) note(0)
new synth saw time(1 1/16) note(3)
new synth saw time(1 3/16) note(7)
