### 3.6: FX All

It is possible to give multiple sounds the same effectsby using the `set all` code

```js
new sample kick_909 time(1/2)
new sample hat_909 time(1/4 1/8)
new synth saw time(3/16) note(0 1) shape(1 1/8) super(3 0.0423)

set all fx(shift -12 0.5) fx(squash 70) fx(reverb 0.5 2)

```
Note that this actually creates individual effects for all thesounds. Meaning they can all have individual modulation speedswhen using a list with arguments
