// === TUTORIAL 222: Overlapping Notes ===
// We can also generate a list of notes for an arpeggiator and
// let the notes overlap by creating a longer length than 
// the space in between the notes

set tempo 110
set scale none

// here the chord progression is repeated 4 times and flattened into a 1d list
list progression flat(repeat(chordsFromNumerals([I IV V VIm]) 4))
print progression

// hear how some of the notes are not played when we turn voice stealing off.
// You can change this by setting voice-stealing to 'on', this is the default
new polySynth sine note(progression 2) time(1/12) shape(1 1/1) steal(off)
