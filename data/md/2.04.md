### 2.4: Note Slide

With the 'slide()' function we can slide the pitchfrom one note to another (called portamento) in a specifiedamount of time (division or milliseconds)

```js
set tempo 123
set scale minor b

list bassLine repeat([3 2 0 -7] 4)
new synth saw note(bassLine 0) shape(2 250) time(1/4) slide(1/8)

```
Try some different values for both
