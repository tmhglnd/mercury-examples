### 6.3: View List RGB

If you merge() three lists you can display Red,Green and Blue values seperately. Make sure the listshave the same length in order to fill all pixels equallyAll lists are normalized together, so if one list has very largenumbers, the other lists will become very dark

```js
list cos mod(cosine(3034 50 0 7) 3)
list sin mod(sine(3034 40 0 7) 3)
list cos2 mod(cosine(3034 20 0 20) 3)

view merge(cos sin cos2)
```
