// === TUTORIAL 413: Clave ===
// Generate random clave patterns. The output is a binary list that represents
// a rhythm, where 1's represent onsets and 0's rests. A clave pattern can be
// found in musical genres such as salsa, mambo, rumba, raggae, raggaeton and 
// more. It is usually defined as an alternation of a beat with 1 or 2 rests
// clave(size)

// Useful to generate random rhythms
