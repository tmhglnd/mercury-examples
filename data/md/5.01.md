### 5.1: MIDI Note

We can also output MIDI notes from the browser to externalinstruments or applications on the computer via WebMidi.This allows us to use Mecruy for generative music whileother applications are handling the sound

```js
new midi default time(1/8) note([0 3 7] 2) gain(0.8)
```
this will send a midi-note to the default devicea gain of 1 is a velocity of 127, 0.8 = 101
