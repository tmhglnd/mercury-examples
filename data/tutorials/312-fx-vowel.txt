// === TUTORIAL 312: FX Vowel ===
// With the vowel effect you can let an instrumt "speak". The effect is a
// filter  that mimics the resonant frequencies of vowels in the human speech, 
// like "o", "a", "u", "i", etc. You can sequence the vowels by putting them in 
// a list. You can also let the instrument slide between the vowels, shift the 
// vowel frequencies with a ratio parameter, and lastly you can adjust the 
// wet-dry balance

set tempo 110 

// choose some random vowels
list vowels choose(8 [o a i e u ])
// the effect works best on spectrally rich sounds, like synths and noise
new synth saw name(talk)
    set talk shape(1 1/8) time(1/8)
	// add the effect with the vowel list and slide time
    set talk fx(vowel vowels 1/4)

// But the effect can also sound interesting on samples like drums!
list drms choose(16 [kick_808 metal snare_808 hat_808 tom_808])
new sample drms time(1/16) fx(vowel vowels)
