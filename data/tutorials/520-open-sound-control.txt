// === TUTORIAL 520: Open Sound Control (OSC) ===
// It is possible to send Open Sound Control (OSC) Messages to Mercury 
// instruments. However this is only possible when running Mercury via a 
// localhost. Go the website below and follow the instructions:
// https://tmhglnd.github.io/mercury/docs/getting-started#-without-internet 

// Now send osc-messages from other applications to 
// ip: 127.0.0.1 (or localhost) at port: 4880

// for example control the note, length, volume and filter of a sawtooth synth
// the osc-addresses are written as strings ''
set tempo 100
new synth saw name(syn0) time(1/16)
	set syn0 note('/synth/note') shape(1 '/synth/length') gain('/synth/vol')
	set syn0 fx(filter low '/synth/cutoff' 0.5)
