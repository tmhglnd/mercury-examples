### 1.9: Panning List

Is with many functions we've seen so far we can alsouse a list for the panning. Or use the argument 'random'to randomize the panning

```js
list panning [-1 -0.75 -0.5 -0.25 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1]
new sample hat_808 time(1/16) pan(panning)
```
this sound will move from left to right

```js
new sample tabla_mid time(1/4) pan(random)
```
this sound will play at a random position in the stereofield
