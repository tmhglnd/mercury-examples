// === TUTORIAL 502: MIDI Duration ===
// With the length() method we can change the duration.
// The duration of a midi-note is determined by the interval between 
// the note-on and note-off message in milliseconds

new midi default time(1/8) note(0 2) length([50 100 150 200])
// the list in length() will send different durations
