// === TUTORIAL 102: Time ===
// A sound is played once per bar by default.
// You can change how often a sound is played in one measure/bar.
// For example 1/4 means 1 bar divided by 4, so 4 times per measure.
// 1/16 means 16 times per measure, etc.

new sample kick_909 time(1/4)
// Try for example: 1/8, 3/16, 1/6, 5/32
