### 3.4: Pitch Shift

With the pitch shifter effect you can change the pitchof a sound in semitones. Allowing you to make melodies witha single sample

```js
set scale harmonic_minor c
new sample chimes time(1/8) fx(shift [0 3 2 -1 7 5]) shape(100)

```
The first argument is the pitch shift in semitones which isalso mapped according to the scale that is setTry changing the values in the function to hear what happensIt is also possible to modulate the parameters with lists
